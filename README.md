PollMonkey (formerly named vote-ape)
=================
This is a vote-for-anything full-stack Node app.

Is is built on *Mongodb* for database, *Express* to handle server requests on top of *Node*, *React* for front-end UI, a.k.a the **MERN** stack.

Rendering is done on the client-side with RESTful API and *React Router*, a React library that routes, keeping the UI and URL in synch.

Theme and UI inspired by [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/).

It is live on [heroku](https://poll-monkey-0220.herokuapp.com/).
